## Project motivation
For this project I wanted to do an Exploratory Data Analysis using the Stack Overflow Annual Developer 2024 Survey. This data sets contains mores than 64000 entries with 114 columns so there were enough data. Also I was kind of interested to know what a salary could be for python developer in Data. I wanted to understand what could influence the salary. And since I would be graduating soon that was a good opportunity.

My project is broke down in two part.
The python code I have made on Jupiter Notebook to help me do the analysis. You will find the ipynb file in this repository.
I analyzed if the years of experience, degree type, location, language were influencing the salary individually or if there were other factors we should be considering to determine the pay of a developer.

The second part of my project is a blog post on Medium. Here is the link on my blogpost

I also use the Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey from their website https://survey.stackoverflow.co/

I also watched the youtuve video of luke Barousse to get knowledge about python code for Data analytics https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUSDVGivd-8&t=35016s
